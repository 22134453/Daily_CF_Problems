## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1800 | [CF187B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/187/B) | Consider the path in segments and each segment is composed of one car. In each segment, if you go from $u$ to $v$ , you can pre-process the minimum time. So you can iterate over the number of segments. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2025/04/0415/solution/cf187b.md) |
| 1900 | [CF353B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/353/B) | Distribute the numbers evenly. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2025/04/0415/solution/cf353b.md) |
