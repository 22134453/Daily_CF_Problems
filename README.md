| ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1600 | [CF430A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/430/A) | "Differ by at most one". Note that the points chosen by an interval are consecutive. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/11/1116/solution/cf430a.md) |
| 2200 | [CF932D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/932/D) | How can you find the first larger predecessor quickly? Jump through the useless predecessors.
